# Feed Reader

This Feed Reader was created by the Udacity coaches as part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Feed Reader project. In this project we were tasked to write tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), a behavior-driven development framework, in /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js, in order to satisfy a number of requirements.

As it stands, the Feed Reader is currently functional and all tests pass. You can even add another RSS feed to the reader by adding it to the `allFeeds` array on line 10 of /js/app.js.

### Getting Started

To get started click the 'Download ZIP' button in the top-right of this repository's master branch, unzip its contents, then cd into the project's folder on the command line.

Next, set up a simple HTTP server with Python by running the following command:

```bash
$> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
$> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Open a browser and visit localhost:8080.
